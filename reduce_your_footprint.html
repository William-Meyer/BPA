    </div>
        <main>  <p>Every person on the planet contributes to the growing, worldwide carbon footprint. However, some peopleâ€™s habits are more detrimental to the environment than others. Nevertheless, every person is able to make small lifestyle changes to aid us in lowering our carbon footprint as a planet. The places of possible improvement can be divided into a few categories, including:
<a href= "#header">Transportation</a>
<a href="">Trash Production</a>
<a href="">Food Consumption</a>
<a href="">Energy Use</a></p><br></br><br></br>

  <h1 id="header">Transportation</h1>
  <div class="con">
      <img src="Assets/imgs/transportation.png" alt= "blue car" id="car"/>
<p id="p2">When fuel is burned, carbon dioxide and other harmful gasses are released. For every gallon of
gas that is burned approximately 24 pounds of greenhouse gasses are emitted. Worldwide,
last year (2020) alone, 34.81 billion metric tons of carbon were emitted.</p></div>
<p>There are many different ways to alter transportation habits for the sake of the environment. Choosing energy-efficient electric vehicles over fuel powered vehicles can significantly
reduce daily pollution levels and help save nonrenewable resources for other, more paramount situations. Choosing to carpool with friends and family and opting for public transportation
instead of individually driving will also decrease the amount of vehicles on the road at a time. If the destination is in close enough proximity to allow it, choosing to ride a bicycle
or walk promotes a healthier lifestyle and decreases the use of fossil fuels. Flying via airplane also takes up 3% of the world's carbon emissions. By decreasing the number of flights
you take in a year, you could greatly reduce your personal carbon footprint.</p>
