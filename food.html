      <h1 class="title">WHAT IS THE ISSUE?</h1>
      <p class="centerText">You may not even think about it but the foods we eat every day can have a huge impact on our carbon footprints. A majority of packaged foods, from bottled drinks to plastic jugs, cardboard snack boxes to individually wrapped desserts, are damaging the environment. Sometimes, it is hard to see the bigger picture. The good news is that even small changes in what we buy and eat can add up to real environmental benefits, including fewer toxic chemicals, reduced global warming emissions, and preservation of our ocean resources. Being contentious about the foods we are consuming and where they are coming from is crucial.</p>

        <h1 class = "title">ALTER EATING HABITS</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Many people donâ€™t think about it but their food choices have a major impact on the environment. Did you know that air emissions from livestock operations make up 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions? (7) This includes meat, dairy, and poultry products. </p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;Methane is released from this livestock fills the environment. Every year, more than 50 billion land animals are raised and slaughtered for food. This massive amount of animals not only releases methane but must go through the process of being prepared to eat, which requires large machinery and lots of waste.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;Choosing to eat more fruits and vegetables, avoiding red meat especially, and being considerate of where the food you eat comes from are crucial in protecting the longevity of the environment.</p>

    <h1 class = "title">EAT LOCALLY</h1>
    <p>&emsp; There are so many advantages of eating locally sourced foods. First of all, eating locally supports local farmers and smaller businesses. Most small businesses take better care to ensure the quality of their products to keep customers satisfied. On top of that, eating locally is much better for the environment. Most produce travels hundreds, even thousands, of miles before reaching your supermarket. This process requires fossil fuels to happen and they harm the environment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;Next time you need to pick up produce, consider going to a local farmers market or a locally owned grocery store to ensure that you get the best quality products and are helping the environment in the process.</p>

    <h1 class = "title">WATCH YOUR WASTE</h1>
    <p>&emsp;Next time you go to the grocery store, look around for just a moment. Take note of just how much packaging there is everywhere. From cereal boxes to cartons of milk to the produce bought in plastic bags, there is future waste everywhere. While some packaging is recyclable, some are not and some will never end up in recycling, even if they could be.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;Be conscientious. Shop with good intentions and think of the environment. Is the store selling milk in cartons rather than plastic jugs? Opt for the carton. Buying produce? Try bringing your own bags to carry it in rather than using the plastic ones provided. Avoid buying individually wrapped snacks and opt for buying things in bulk when you can to avoid unnecessary waste.</p>
