      <p class="centerText">Sometimes, simple changes to the products that a person uses can create a large change in the size of their carbon footprint. Here are some examples of substitutions to everyday products that can be used to help protect the environment from the massive amounts of greenhouse gasses and waste being produced.</p>

        <p>Why? It is estimated that 500 billion plastic water bottles are used and discarded every year worldwide,
        an estimated 156 bottles used per person yearly! By removing the dependency on plastic bottles,
        it can protect the environment greatly. Water filters provide clean drinking water while eliminating the need to continuously buy it at the
        store. Purchasing a reusable alternative to the plastic throw-away bottles decreases the amount of plastic ending up in landfills and the
         ocean.</p>

        <p>Why? When you go to pack your lunch for school or work, it is common to reach for a plastic zipper bag or plastic container,
        and although reusable plastic containers are significantly better than the non-reusable alternatives, they are still made of large amounts of plastic.
        Plastic can take anywhere from 50-200 years to decompose, so, once these reusable containers become worn out and need to be replaced,
        they will end up sitting in landfills for years on end. A better alternative to plastic containers is biodegradable bento boxes, which can
        break down in roughly 2 years, significantly faster than common plastics.</p>

    <p>Clothing dryers are a modern luxury, allowing people to quickly finish their loads of laundry and keep their clothes clean.
    However, there are ways to make this practice more sustainable. While air-drying your clothing can reduce the average householdâ€™s carbon footprint
    by 2,400 pounds, sometimes it is not practical for larger households. However, using wool dryer balls in the dryer
    can significantly reduce the time it takes for the clothing to dry. This results in smaller amounts of energy being used, saving both your energy bill
    and the environment at the same time.</p>

        <p>Why? Plastic bags are manufactured using non-renewable resources like crude oil, and shipping them produces significant greenhouse gasses.
        By using reusable bags you are saving resources, and reducing your carbon footprint. In addition, because you can use these bags over and over again
        it significantly cuts down on waste production. Reusable bags are a cheap and convenient alternative to single use plastic.</p>

        <p>Why? It is estimated that almost 390 million plastic straws are used daily in the United States alone. These straws are manufactured in
        factories that emit large amounts of greenhouse gasses. Along with this, plastic straws cannot be recycled, creating more waste. Reusable
        straws are a cheap, sustainable alternative to single use plastics. They cut down on your carbon footprint, waste production, and are very

        <p>Why? Rechargeable batteries are a simple way to save the planet and your wallet. The one time purchase of reusable batteries will
        last significantly longer than their single use alternative. The energy required to recharge the batteries is significantly lower than
        what is needed for traditional batteries. Waste production is also lowered because you donâ€™t need to dispose of these batteries constantly.
        These small changes significantly reduces energy use and trash production.</p>

          <p>Why? Toilet paper is a major contributor to climate change. Massive amounts of trees are torn down every day to fuel the massive amounts
          of toilet paper being used. Trees pull carbon from the atmosphere and slow down the rate of climate change. Over 20,000 trees are flushed down
          the toilet every day. However, a bidet provides a much more eco-friendly alternative.

          <p>Why? Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) are one of the most energy efficient type of light bulbs. They use 75% less energy than traditional
          incandescent bulbs and can last up to 10 times longer. CFLs are also a cost efficient solution, costing less than $5 a bulb on average. Light-Emitting
          Diode (LEDs) are also a great energy efficient solution but they are more expensive averaging around $12 per bulb.</p>
