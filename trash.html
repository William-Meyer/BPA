      <h1 class="title">WHAT IS THE ISSUE?</h1>
      <p class="centerText">The production of inorganic materials uses natural resources (water, timber, fuel, etc.) which causes carbon emissions. When organic waste breaks down, it releases gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, into the air. The waste management process also releases an abundance of gasses from all the transportation and incineration used to get rid of all the trash.</p>

        <h1 class = "title">RECYCLING</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Instead of tossing that bottle you’ve just finished into the trash can, decide to take the first step to help the environment. Choosing to recycle waste products is significantly better for the environment than leaving them to decompose in a landfill. As waste decomposes, it releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;Recycling conserves all sorts of natural resources. For example, recycling paper products saves forests and trees. Recycling also reduces the need to harvest more resources from the earth. The constant harvesting of these resources increases the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere, as well as damaging ecosystems, and affecting the lives of millions of animals worldwide.</p>

    <h1 class = "title">COMPOSTING</h1>
    <p>&emsp;Each year, the landfills and trash incinerators receive over 167 million tons of trash (1). Within the trash cans left out at the road to be taken off to landfills, roughly half of the waste is compostable. Composting has huge benefits and it’s incredibly easy to do. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;Composting increases soil fertility and can help filter out harmful chemicals damaging it. Composted soil is more nutrient-rich and can hold onto these helpful nutrients for longer than normal soil. It’s got massive benefits! Plus, composting results in less harmful greenhouse gases, specifically methane, being released into the atmosphere. Instead, these gases are converted into compost and not only save the environment but benefit you!</p>

    <h1 class = "title">REDUCING WASTE</h1>
    <p>&emsp;The average person’s lifestyle results in them producing large amounts of trash daily. The average American produces 4.2 pounds of waste a day. (2) That’s more than 1,500 pounds of trash a year! That’s roughly three times the global average. (3)</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;Simple changes can be made however to lower this amount of waste production. Changes as simple as swapping throwaway plastic bags for their reusable cloth alternatives or deciding to use a reusable metal water bottle instead can create a massive change in the amount of plastic ending up in landfills. Other small changes that can be made include using rechargeable batteries, buying clothes secondhand from thrift stores or yard sales, and avoiding fast fashion can greatly reduce the amount of waste produced worldwide yearly.</p>

    <h1 class = "title">ALTER EATING HABITS</h1>
    <p>&emsp;Food packaging accounts for 50% of the plastics created with fossil fuels.(4)  From bags of chips to produce wrapped in plastics to plastic jugs of milk, food packaging is everywhere. Even worse, most of this packaging is not reusable nor recyclable. Therefore, a large majority of this waste ends up in landfills. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp;Opting to buy foods with recycled packaging, more environmentally friendly packaging (for example, paper milk cartons rather than plastic), or no packaging altogether, such as fresh produce sold at local markets and smaller grocery stores, can greatly reduce the amount of garbage thrown away into landfills. Buying in bulk and avoiding individually wrapped snacks can also be easy changes to make and ultimately avoids more throwaway plastics.</p>
